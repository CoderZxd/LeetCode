//392. 判断子序列
//        给定字符串 s 和 t ，判断 s 是否为 t 的子序列。
//        你可以认为 s 和 t 中仅包含英文小写字母。字符串 t 可能会很长（长度 ~= 500,000），而 s 是个短字符串（长度 <=100）。
//        字符串的一个子序列是原始字符串删除一些（也可以不删除）字符而不改变剩余字符相对位置形成的新字符串。（例如，"ace"是"abcde"的一个子序列，而"aec"不是）。
//
//        示例 1:
//        s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
//        返回 true.
//
//        示例 2:
//        s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
//        返回 false.
//
//        后续挑战 :
//        如果有大量输入的 S，称作S1, S2, ... , Sk 其中 k >= 10亿，你需要依次检查它们是否为 T 的子序列。在这种情况下，你会怎样改变代码？
